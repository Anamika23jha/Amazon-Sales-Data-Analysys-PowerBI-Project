- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened for 51291 rows so we need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "Postal Code". 
- Step 5 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.

- Step 7 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for three fields named "Quarter", "Year" & "Country".
- Step 8 : Four card visuals were added to the canvas, that represent Sales Projection, Product Unit, KPI, Sales Projection.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
           
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored.
